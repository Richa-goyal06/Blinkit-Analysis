# Blinkit Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze Blinkitâ€™s sales, outlet performance, and customer trends. The dashboard provides a unified, interactive view for business stakeholders to track sales KPIs, outlet metrics, product category performance, and customer ratings, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Dashboard 1: Summary
Blinkit operates across various outlet types and locations. To optimize sales and customer satisfaction, businesses need insights into revenue distribution, product demand, outlet size performance, and customer preferences.
This project builds a Power BI dashboard that visualizes:
- Total Sales ($1.20M), Average Sales per Outlet ($140.99), and Average Rating (3.92).
- Category-wise contribution (e.g., Snacks, Fruits, Dairy).
- Outlet establishment trends across years.
- Sales segmentation by fat content, outlet size, and tier location.
- Comparison of outlet types (Grocery Stores vs. Supermarkets) on multiple KPIs.

## Process :
- Data Preparation (Excel): Cleaned and structured raw sales data; handled missing values and standardized categories.
- Data Modeling (Power BI): Built relationships, created calculated fields (e.g., sales by tier, fat percentage), and prepared a star schema for reporting.
- Dashboard Development: Designed interactive visuals, slicers, and drill-down filters for multi-dimensional analysis.
- 
## Project insight
- Tier 3 locations generated the highest total sales ($472K), indicating strong demand in smaller cities.
- Medium-sized outlets performed better overall, contributing 42% of total revenue.
- Grocery stores achieved the highest revenue ($1.51M) compared to supermarket types.
- Regular fat content products contributed 65% of sales, showing higher consumer preference.
- Sales peaked around outlets established in 2018, with a gradual decline afterward.

## Final Conclusion
This Blinkit Analysis Dashboard enables stakeholders to track performance metrics, identify top-performing outlets, and analyze customer buying trends. By combining data cleaning, modeling, and interactive visualization, the project provides actionable insights to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and regional sales planning.
